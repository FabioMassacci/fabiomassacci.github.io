# PhD Topics for NFSC Funded Students by Fabio Massacci

## Interesting Topics

I'm interested in all topics of experimental cybersecurity, risk analysis and security economics. See my [web page](index.md).

Particularly relevant and interesting topics would be 
- _Economics of Cybersecurity Software Certification_. This theme is particularly relevant for a number of Chinese companies (most notably Huawei) which are subject to an 
intense scrutiny over their software development process. See for example [the UK NCSC Document]()
- _Cybersecurity of Pandemics_. There are gazillions of proposal for tracing apps. The empirical evidence is that if you look carefully at the data of 
places that claimed to have put that in place highly invasive contact tracing (e.g. South Korea and China), you find out that what really worked was protection of medical staff 
and tracing of infected people rather than general contact tracing. People invented all kind of schemes to eschew that. The key researcgh question is therefore what is _really_ 
useful?
- _Vulnerability Prioritization for large enterprises_. It is well known that the US NVD and the Chinese NVD have different prioritizations and 
different time scales for vulnerabilities. You can of course spin all kind of conspiracy theories (choose your bad guy here) but I believe there are more mundane explanations 
and these explanations could help us in providing better guidance to large enterprises.

In the realm of security economics I'm mostly interested in the notion of
- _Malicious High Frequency Trading_. This is an activity I started with Jing Nie (see below), but paused due to lack of time. Trading is by definition adversarial, but 
we define a trading a malicious when a trader tries to actually exploit features of the _implementation_ of the trading mechanism that would not otherwise work if trading was
perfect as the theory suggest. Front-running trying to exploits millisecond in optical cable speeds is actually a good example.
- _Systemic Risks for Cyberinsurance_. When developers use a library all applications that use that libraries become potentially vulnerable. If you buy cyberinsurance for 
potential data losses of course the insurer must spread the risk across a diverse population. But software libraries are all the same. So what is the correct way of pricing that?

I've also worked in mechanisms for _secure (crypto-based) distributed trading_ (See our FutureMEX paper) and if you are interested in that just let me know.

If you would be interested in another topic I haven't though about, let me know. I like to be challenged.
