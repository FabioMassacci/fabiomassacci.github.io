# Fabio Massacci Personal Information

PhD in Computer Science, MSc in Computer Engineering, Master in International Relations

## Where I am now

I am chair of Foundational and Experimental Security at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I'm also part-time professor at the 
University of Trento, Italy.

If you want to know where I physically are: somewhere in an office, in a home, most likely logged on digital video platform (Zoom, Google Meet, CISCO WebEx, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, ...). You can check my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fabio.massacci@ieee.org)

# What I Do 

# Paper Highlight

## Research Topics
- Data and models for vulnerabilities and exploits in the wild
= Security economics
- Empirical validation of risk and security methodologies
- Security testbeds and malware analysis

Less Active 	
Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE)
Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT for representing crypto-problems as logical problems (See for new ongoing development as well). I have some new interest in this so if you are interested drop me an email.

## Awards 	

# Impact 	

## Scientific Awards
- 2015: Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference] for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
- 2001: AI*IA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence

## Industry Impact
My research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC (Comparing Vulnerability Severity and Exploits Using Case-Control Studies) or our pre-print copy.
See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1

# Collaborators

# Contact 

Send me an email (that is a good joke). You can use either my VU Amsterdam address "<initial-of-voornaam>.<achternaam>@vu.nl"or my UTrento address "<nome>.<cognome>@unitn.it" or you might try with my IEEE address "<name>.<surname>@ieee.org".
  
You might also directly call me at my phone number in the official web page of the Departments.
