# CV in Brief

Fabio Massacci (MEng'92, PhD'98 Computer Engineering, MA'95 in International Relations) has been in Rome, Cambridge, Toulouse, Trento, and now Amsterdam. He held
visiting positions in Durham, Koblenz, Lueven, Marina del Rey, and Oslo. He has published more than 250 articles on various 
aspects of security and has received the 10 years Most Influential Paper Award by the IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference in 2015 for his 2005 work on secuirty and trust
in socio-technical systems. He has coordinated several European projects and including the SECONOMICS project on socio-economic aspects of security. He coordinates the education 
and skills workpackage of the CyberSec4Europe European pilot for an European Competence Center and he is the coordinator on the AssureMOSS project on open source 
security ("Built everywhere, secured in Europe"). His is interested in foundational and experimental aspects of security.

## Research Topics
- Data and models for vulnerabilities and exploits in the wild
= Security economics
- Empirical validation of risk and security methodologies
- Security testbeds and malware analysis

## Less Active Research Topics 	
- Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE)
- Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT for representing crypto-problems as logical problems (See for new ongoing development as well). I have some old lover's interest in 
this so if you are interested drop me an email.

# Impact 	

## Scientific Awards
- 2015: Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference] for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
- 2001: AI*IA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence

## Industry Impact
My research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC (Comparing Vulnerability Severity and Exploits Using Case-Control Studies) or our pre-print copy.
See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1
