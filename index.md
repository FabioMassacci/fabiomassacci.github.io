# Minimal `jekyll-theme-minimal` gem

### Fabio Massacci

This theme was ported from the GitHub Automatic Page Generator to a Jekyll v3.3 theme gem.

To use it on a Pages site, add `theme: jekyll-theme-minimal` to your `_config.yml`.

```yml
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
title: Custom title
description: Custom description.
show_downloads: true
google_analytics:
```

- To override the repository name or description from GitHub used in the header, set a `title` or `description`.
- Set `show_downloads` to `false` to hide the download buttons in the header.
- Set `google_analytics` to your tracking ID to enable pageview tracking.

This theme includes a single `default` layout. Markdown files should be prefixed with the following frontmatter.

```
---
layout: default
---
```

#### CSS

For CSS customization, create your own `/assets/css/styles.scss` in your project to replace the one from this theme, and override selected stylesheet properties.

```scss
---
---
@import "fonts";
@import "rouge-github";
@import "minimal";
```

#### Syntax Highlighting

[Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) is the default highlighter in Jekyll 3. This theme includes the `github` stylesheet from Rouge.
