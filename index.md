### Less Active Research Topics 	
- Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE). But you can still check my 
- (Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT)[https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/CryptoSAT/] for representing crypto-problems as logical problems. This was an instrumental technology for the recent collision found on SHA-1. I have some old lover's interest in 
this so if you are interested drop me an email.

#### Papers 
You can find most of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gC_ZVPgAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55167501300), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1091-8486) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/59/6145.html).

You can also find some of them on [Trento's web page](https://securitylab.disi.unitn.it/doku.php?id=publications). The VU Amsterdam group page is coming soon.

# Impact 	

## Scientific Awards
- 2015: [Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference](https://requirements-engineering.org/#awards) for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
- 2001: AIxIA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence

## Industry Impact
- My research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC
- Our Work on Security-economics and risk was "owned" by National Grid UK/US who advocated it at high level meetings (UK Cabinet Meeting and EU presidency) and within E-ENTSOE.
- See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1

# Contacts and Appointments

Send me an email (that is a good joke). You can use 
> - my Amsterdam address "initial-of-vornaam.achternaam>@vu.nl",
> - my Trento address "nome.cognome>@unitn.it",
> - my IEEE address "name.surname>@ieee.org".

Alternatively you may contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-massacci-b3199225/). This is the only social network I use.

If you want to know where I am or talk to me, check my [IEEE Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fabio.massacci@ieee.org). Most likely on digital platform somewhere.

You might also directly call me at my phone number in the official web page of the Departments.

# Lectures and Teaching

For the lectures, it is a lot better that you check the web pages of the University. Those ones are always updated (and anyhow they are the ones that i have to use).

For Master Thesis, send me an email from your students' account. Try to read the bio to make sure that I'm sort of interested in the things you want to do. I also supervise Thesis carried in industry with some caveat in terms of their organization.

# Civil Society Engagement

- 1995: International habilitation as United Nation Officer (Level P2)
- 1992-1997: European Executive Board Member and European Treasurer of Service Civil International. If you think that is strange, I have been also strongly involved in the sector of International Voluntary Service Organizations and Peace Movements. Now I'm more active in supporting Fair Trade Organization. 
- Read an essay written for a post-degree Foreign Relations course by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. I advocated a different relationship between Western Democracies and Militant Islam, rather than funding conservative islamist leaders (like Saddam Hussein or Saudi princes) to bash communists. History proved me right. Download it in [Postscript](https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/Publications/mass-95-SIOI.ps) 
- I met my wife [Beatrice De Blasi](https://beatricedeblasi.photoshelter.com/index) while working in the NGO sector.
