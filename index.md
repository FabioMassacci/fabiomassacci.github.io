# Fabio Massacci Personal Web Page
PhD in Computer Science, MSc in Computer Engineering, Master in International Relations

I am chair of Foundational and Experimental Security at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I'm also part-time professor at the 
University of Trento, Italy.

## Where I am now

Somewhere in an office, in a home, most likely on digital platform. You can check my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fabio.massacci@ieee.org)

## Some
A Political Statement 	
On a staged massacre of activits in the Philippines by Army and the Police. This seems at odd with a professor's job except this time I know a name on the list...
Research 	
See also UNITN Security Group Wiki
Data and models for vulnerabilities and exploits in the wild
Security economics
Empirical validation of risk and security methodologies
Security testbeds and malware analysis
Less Active 	
Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE)
Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT for representing crypto-problems as logical problems (See for new ongoing development as well). I have some new interest in this so if you are interested drop me an email.
Security-by-Contract for Mobile and Smart Card
Practical Enforcement of Information Flow Properties
Cryptographic Protocol Verification. See Larry Paulson's SET protocol page for the papers and the proof scripts).
Automated Reasoning for Modal, Description and Security Logics
Awards 	
2015: Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference] for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
2001: AI*IA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence
Impact 	
Our research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC (Comparing Vulnerability Severity and Exploits Using Case-Control Studies) or our pre-print copy.
See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1
