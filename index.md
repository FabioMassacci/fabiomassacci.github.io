# All You Wanted to Know 

## One's life in one line
> - Fabio Massacci (MEng'92, PhD'98 Computer Engineering, MA'95 in International Relations), married with two children, has been in Rome, Cambridge, Toulouse, Trento, and 
> Amsterdam. He held visiting positions in Durham, Koblenz, Lueven, Marina del Rey, and Oslo. 

## Three standard deviations in three lines
> - He is one of the few professors who has presented in top hackers' venues (BlackHat USA, Asia), top computer security conferences (ACM CCS, IEEE S&P), 
> top empirical software engineering journals (ESEJ, IEEE TSE) and top risk analysis journals (Risk Analysis). For his work on security and trust in socio-technical systems he 
> has received the [*Ten years Most Influential Paper Award*](https://requirements-engineering.org/#awards) by the IEEE Requirements Engineering. He has coordinated several
> European > projects (including a multidisciplinary projects with economist, sociologists abd computer scientists on socio-economic aspects of security SECONOMICS). 
> He is the coordinator on the [H2020 AssureMOSS project](https://assuremoss.eu/) on open source security risk assessment and certification 
> ("Written everywhere, Secured in Europe").
> - While almost all professors are *sellers* of technologies (through their papers or their spin-offs) he was for 7 years deputy rectors for ICT procurements and services 
> supervising a 70+ workforce and several millions Euro in outsourcing contracts. This made him a *buyer* of computing technology and a *user* of risk analysis. His perspective
> of what is a useful security technology or a useful risk analysis is shaped by this experience and very diverse: prestigious corporations are not longer (only) the place to send your > students or funders of your research, they are sloppy suppliers selling overpriced products.
> - He actively participated to the civil society working as a volunteer with underprivilege people and in refugee camps. He held, among others, the post 
> of European Executive member and Treasurer of Service Civil International an international NGO with consultative status at UNESCO and the European Youth forum. For his MA he
> wrote a dissertation on the cooperation between democracies and social islamic movements (instead of funding dictators). He qualified at the world-wide competition to become
> an U.N. Officer but eventually opted to be an Assistant Professor (ok, nobody is perfect).

## Less Active Research Topics 	
- Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE). But you can still check my 
- [Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT](https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/CryptoSAT/) for representing crypto-problems as logical problems. This was an instrumental 
technology for the recent collision found on SHA-1. I have some old lover's interest in 
this so if you are interested drop me an email.

# Impact 	

## Scientific Awards
- 2015: [Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference](https://requirements-engineering.org/#awards) for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
- 2001: AIxIA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence

## Industry Impact
- My research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC
- Our Work on Security-economics and risk was "owned" by National Grid UK/US who advocated it at high level meetings (UK Cabinet Meeting and EU presidency) and within E-ENTSOE.
- See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1

# Civil Society Engagement
 
- 1995: International habilitation as United Nation Officer (Level P2)
- 1992-1997: European Executive Board Member and European Treasurer of Service Civil International.
- 1992-1993 Italian Treasurer for the Italian Consortium of Solidarity working on relief work in what at the time were the former republics of Yugoslavia
- Read an essay written for a professional Master in International Relations by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Italian Defence Center. I advocated a different relationship between Western Democracies and Militant Islam, rather than funding conservative islamist leaders (like Saddam Hussein or Saudi princes) to bash communists. History proved me right. Download it in [Postscript](https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/Publications/mass-95-SIOI.ps) 

 If you think that is strange, I have been also strongly involved in the sector of International Voluntary Service Organizations and Peace Movements. Now I'm more active in
 supporting Fair Trade Organization. I have a special relationship with the Philippines as I personally know quite a few activists of the human rights and fair trade movement
 there.
 
 I met my wife [Beatrice De Blasi](https://beatricedeblasi.photoshelter.com/index) while working in the NGO sector.

Alternatively you may contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-massacci-b3199225/). This is the only social network I use.

If you want to know where I am or talk to me, check my [IEEE Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fabio.massacci@ieee.org). Most likely on digital platform somewhere.

You might also directly call me at my phone number in the official web page of the Departments.

# Lectures and Teaching

For the lectures, it is a lot better that you check the web pages of the University. Those ones are always updated (and anyhow they are the ones that i have to use).

For Master Thesis, send me an email from your students' account. Try to read the bio to make sure that I'm sort of interested in the things you want to do. I also supervise Thesis carried in industry with some caveat in terms of their organization.

I have several [Research projects]() for motivated students, roughly they correspond to 6 or 12 ECTS.
