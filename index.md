### Less Active Research Topics 	
- Modelling Security Requirements Engineering (Now I do experiments on SRE). But you can still check my 
- Logical Cryptanalysis or Crypto with SAT for representing crypto-problems as logical problems (See for new ongoing development as well). I have some old lover's interest in 
this so if you are interested drop me an email.

#### Papers 
You can find most of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gC_ZVPgAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55167501300), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1091-8486) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/59/6145.html).

You can also find them on [Trento's web page](https://securitylab.disi.unitn.it/doku.php?id=publications). I don't have a VU Amsterdam group page yet).

# Impact 	

## Scientific Awards
- 2015: Ten Years Most Influential Paper Award at IEEE Requirements Engineering Conference] for our paper on Modeling security requirements through ownership, permission and delegation. You can read our pre-print copy or see our presentation at RE'15.
- 2001: AIxIA - Marco Somalvico Career Award for Young Researchers in AI by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence

## Industry Impact
- My research on risk reduction for vulnerability assessment made its way to the world standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3. You can see our Black Hat'13 presentation read the full paper on ACM TISSEC
- Our Work on Security-economics and risk was "owned" by National Grid UK/US who advocated it at high level meetings (UK Cabinet Meeting and EU presidency) and within E-ENTSOE.
- See the recent development of an intellectual child of mine: Logical Cryptanalysis was instrumental to break SHA-1

# Teaching

If you are an interested student, it is a lot better that you check the web pages of the University. Those ones are always updated (and anyhow they are the ones that i have to use).
